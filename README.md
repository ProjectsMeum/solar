# **solar** - EV car charging with solar power

### Charge your car with solar power

The purpose of this application is to maximise electric vehicle (EV) charging with locally produced solar power. The application monitors the power fed into the grid, and switches car charging on, if the car is at home, needs charging and enough power is collected from the solar panels. 

The application runs on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with Python 3.7.3, and uses the modbus API of E3DC and the unofficial Tesla API.

The documentation shows how it works and how to configure the application.
